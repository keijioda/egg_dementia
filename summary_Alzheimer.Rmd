## Aim

* Association between egg intake and the incidence of Alzheimerâ€™s disease in the AHS-2 cohort linked with Medicare data
* This summary focuses on the outcome of Alzheimer's disease, not including other types of dementia

## Datasets

* Medicare data
  * For details regarding Medicare data, see [AHS-2 Medicare Linkage](https://github.com/keijioda/ahs_medicare_linkage/blob/main/summary.md) repository.
  
  * Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF), 2008-2020
    * Contains beneficiary characteristics and enrollment information
    
  * Chronic Conditions file (CC), 2008-2020
    * Contains the first occurrence date of 27 specific chronic conditions
    * Used to identify prevalent/incident cases of dementia and/or Alzheimer's disease and
    * to identify comorbidities
    
  * Both files include n = 44,585 unique subjects across years, after excluding 
    * Gender/DOB mismatch with AHS-2 data
    * Dupulicate beneficiary IDs and SSNs

* For AHS-2 baseline data, including food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ), a guided multiple imputation was used to fill missing data ([Fraser & Yan, 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17259903/))
  * Five imputed data sets were generated for subsequent analyses (See the analysis section for more details)
  * For descriptive analysis, we present results from the first imputed data

* AHS-2 baseline imputed data #1: n = 41,041
  * ~~Among this, n = 383 subjects were excluded because they opted out of the study~~
  * ~~After removing opt-outs, there were n = 87,668 subjects~~
  * Opt-outs were already excluded
  
* After merging Medicare and AHS-2 data, there were n = 41,041 subjects.

## Inclusion/exclusion criteria

* Medicare beneficiaries who did not reach the age of 65 between 2008 and 2020 (e.g., younger beneficiaries with disabilities or end-stage renal disease) were excluded, resulting n = 39,709.

* Subjects with extreme BMI (<16 or >60), according to AHS questionnaire, were excluded, resulting n = 39,626.

* Prevalent cases of Alzheimer's disease
  * If the first diagnosis was made before AHS-2 enrollment or within 6 months after the enrollment, consider it as a prevalent case
  * n = 109 such prevalent cases were excluded, resulting n = 39,517 subjects
  
* Unverified dates of deaths
  * Medicare data include a variable (`VALID_DEATH_DT_SW`) indicating whether a beneficiary's day of death has been verified by the Social Security Administration or the Railroad Retirement Board.
  * There were 19 unverified death dates. Excluding these resulted n = 39,498.

## Dietary variables 

* Gram intakes of 3 food groups (meat, fish, and dairy) were calculated (gram/day) according to AHS-2 food frequency questionnaire. 

* For each food group, its dietary intake was energy-adjusted by the residual method, while partitioning zero intake ([Jaceldo-Siegl et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3433053/)). Due to its highly right-skewed distribution, non-zero intake was log-transformed before being regressed on the total energy intake. Residuals were added by the mean of log and then back-transformed to obtain energy-adjusted dietary intake. Energy-adjusted dietary intake was added with (unadjusted) supplement intake to form energy-adjuste total intake.

* Subjects were then divided into 4 intake levels. 
  * For meat and fish, about 50% of subjects indicated zero intake and they were classified to a non-consumption group. The rest of the subjects were approximately equally allocated to 3 consumption groups according to their intake. 
   * Similarly for dairy, about 11% of subjects reported zero consumption. 
  * For other food group variables, subjects were divided into approximately 4 quartile groups.
  * For cut-off values of the four food groups, please see the descriptive table below.

* Mean and 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles of gram intake by intake group are shown below:

## Cox models

* To examine risk factors associated with incident Alzheimer's disease, we employed the Cox proportional hazards model with attained age as the time scale
  * Age at entry was calculated based on the return date of AHS-2 questionnaire
  * Those who died during the follow-up were censored at the date of death verified in Medicare data
  * Those who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after 6 months following study enrollment were identified as incident cases and their age at diagnosis was calculated. 
    * The mean follow-up years was 15.3 years (median 16.7 years)
    * The total person-years of follow-up was 603,754 years
  * The main exposure variable of interest was the frequency of egg intake.
    * In the AHS-2 baseline questionnaire, the frequency of egg intake was measured in 9 categories, as shown in "Dietary variables" section above.
    * Based on its distribution, egg frequency was re-categorized into 5 groups (see the "Descriptive table" section)
  * Other food group variables were categorized into 4 intake group, as descrived in "Dietary variable." section.

* (Describe multivariable Cox models here -- refer to the Excel file containing model results)
  * The models were run for each imputed data sets, yielding 5 sets of estimated beta coefficients and their variance-covariance matrix
  * These results were combined according to Rubin's rule, and the pooled estimates of HRs and their 95% confidence intervals were produced
  * All analyses were performed on R version 4.4.3
  
* Table XX:
  * Unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) is shown in the first column of Table XX for each covariate
  * ~~Multivariable model 1 includes all covariates except for total energy intake (Unit: per 100 kcal/day) and 4 food group vairables~~
  * ~~In Multivariable model 2, dietary pattern was removed and all 4 food group variables were added, while also adjusting for total energy intake.~~ 
* Trend p-values were displayed for ordinal variables (education, BMI categories, exercise, sleep hours and food group intakes) in multivariable models.
* The proportional hazards assumption was assessed with visual inspection of plots of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for each covariate. None of the covariates showed severe violation of the assumption.

## Cox models with cubic spline terms for food group variables

* In the Cox models above:
  * Five categories of egg frequency were used.
  * Other food group variables were categorized into 4 intake groups.

* Instead of using these dietary variables as categorical, energy-adjusted gram weights of intake were entered into the models as continuous. Since the previous Cox models suggest a non-linear association between egg intake and our disease outcome, restricted cubic spline of energy-adjusted egg intake (gram/day) was used to model the nonlinearity. For other food groups, restricted cubic splines were employed if there is a statistically significant non-linear term; otherwise only the linear term was entered into the model.
  * The number of knots in the cubic splines was set to 4 knots.
  
* Among dietary variables, only the egg intake indicated a non-linear association
  * A plot of adjusted hazard ratio was produced to visualize how HR changes over a range of egg intake. 
  * For eggs, an intake of 10 gram/day was chosen to be its reference value of the HR plot.

## Supplementary analysis

### Comparison of egg intake at baseline and at HHF6 questionnaire

* Frequency of egg intake was compared between the baseline questionnaire and HHF version 6
  * In HHF6, the frequency of egg intake was asked in the same format as in the baseline questionnaire (9 options)
  * Among our analytic sample, there are n = 23,906 subjects (60.4%) who returned HHF6 questionnaire
  * After excluding n = 743 invalid responses on egg frequency, there were n = 23,163 in the crosstab below
  * (Columns are egg frequency at baseline; Rows are from HHF6)

* The percentage of exact agreement (# in the main diagonals / total) was 39%. The percent of adjacent agreement (including those one above/below the main diagonals as agreement) was 74%. The Fleiss-Cohen weighted Kappa was 0.46.

## Notes for additional analyses

* ~~Combine semi- and non-vegetarians into one group and make this as reference -- Done.~~

* Run the following models:
  * ~~MV1 + egg (retain dietary groups) -- Done. HRs very similar to those in Model 1 or 2.~~
  * ~~Separate meat into two food group variables, beef and poultry, while excluding pork from the model -- Still waiting for data from DS.~~
  * Explore interactions between meat (as a whole) and egg intake -- The interaction term was not significant at all (p = 0.69).

* TO DO
  * ~~Get meat sub-group variables (both gram and kcal intake) from Lars? -- see below~~
  * ~~Incorporate VB12, omega-3, and folate from lupus data -- For a separate paper~~
  * Get data with correct dairy intake
  * Get all imputed datasets and run analysis for pooled HR estimates
  * Get HHF6 data to compare egg intake with baseline -- Done
  * Exclude those subjects who live outside the US for some time during follow-up -- Done, none found in the data

* Concerns:
  * ~~RTI Race -- see the [definition of RTI race](https://resdac.org/cms-data/variables/research-triangle-institute-rti-race-code): what to do with others? Exclude them?~~
  * Egg eaters among vegans? -- misclassification
  * ~~Definition of physical activity: Look for Vichuda's paper -- Changed exercise min/wk~~
  * ~~Separate hypertension and hyperlipidemia -- Done~~
  * ~~Include anemia as a comorbidity variable -- Done~~
  * ~~Semi-veg: exclude them entirely, or keep it combined with non-veg?~~

* Plans
  * Two papers:
    * Egg intake and dementia (1st paper)
    * Dietary pattern and dementia (2nd paper)
  
  * For the first paper;
    * ~~For egg intake, use its frequency -- need to collapse~
    * ~~Need other food groups: vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts/seeds, legumes -- get data from GF (along with meat as food group)~~
    * ~~Need nutrient variables: Carotenoids (LYCO, LUTE, LZ, ZEA)? -- JO to think about~~
    * ~~Crosstab b/w egg and meat intake -- Done~~
    * ~~Mean/percentiles by egg intake group -- Done~~
    * ~~Re-label egg intake groups~~
    * Model with and without comobidity
      * Model 1a: Demographics and lifestyle + Egg
      * Model 1b: Add comorbidity
      * ~~Model 2a: Model 1a + other food groups~~
      * Model 2b: Model 1b + other food groups
    
  * For the second paper:
    * Keep semi-veg together with non-veg for now
